# Strange Caves

Strange Caves is a procedural exploration game originally created for the [**2026.1 Brackeys Game Jam (Brackeys 15)**](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-15).

The initial jam version was developed in a week and published on itch.io as a small experimental prototype.

## About The Project

Strange Caves began as a short game jam entry focused on procedural cave generation and exploration. After the jam ended, I decided to continue developing the project.

The game is evolving into a research-driven exploration experience centered around:

* Procedurally generated terrain
* Biome-based world generation
* Layered planetary strata
* Chunk-based world streaming
* Deterministic autotiling
* Physics integration using Matter.js
* Early experimentation with lighting systems

The current focus is on building a solid technical foundation that supports:

* Infinite or large-scale world generation
* Extensible biome systems
* Performance-optimized chunk loading
* Deterministic visual variation
* Expandable gameplay systems

## Development Direction

While the jam version focused on caves, the long-term vision is shifting toward:

* Scientific exploration
* Procedural planets
* Environmental variation across different worlds
* Data-driven ecosystem simulation

The project is being developed as both a game and an engine architecture experiment.

## Future Plans

* Light System from scratch
* Inventory, Crafting, building systems
* Interactive UI to see temperature, gravity, humidity, oxigen levels, air pressure.
* A gameplay loop (since the game jam version is only exploring)
* Additional procedural features (vegetation, minerals, procedural structures)
* Research and Survival aspects
* New vehicles
* Block, liquid and rope physics
